        <h4>Who I Am</h4>
        <p>
            I am a fairly young junior dev, having worked in the payment processing and reporting industry professionally. Most of my work consisted of updating the front end of our applications,originally created in VB6, to using WebView. Although I have this experience of web development, I am completely self-taught in the area, and have more experience creating "widgets" and the like, rather than more traditional websites. One of my goals in creating this site is to expand my knowledge of web development above that of creating desktop application-like interfaces. I also have professional experience in server-side processing, for the sake of SMS relays to aid in notifications and work-order management for on-call employees.

            In my personal projects, I love to explore the low-level operation of electronics. Be it embedded programming, compilers and their operation, or means of optimizing programs. I love to dig deep into what's going on under the hood of software, rather than allowing that framework to exist as a black box. I typically like to look at the layers of software that interface with computer hardware, learning about the abstraction needed to get to the point of writing in modern, high-level languages.

        <h4>My Interests</h4>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, I like to get to the low-level, nitty-gritty of how a program and computer operate. In addition, I like to look and learn about Linux systems, green computing principles, and networking. My personal projects and endeavors almost always follow one of those paths. I also enjoy branching out and dipping my feet into other areas when I can, just to learn more about software development as a whole and take insight from other sub-disciplines to apply in my areas of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my passion for software, I enjoy outdoors and nature-focused activities. I'm an avid hiker and cross-country skier -- making sure that I am able to get outside year-round. I also enjoy whittling, cooking, and playing guitar! I like to keep my hobbies creative to help with the process of writing software, as well as offsetting the more technical nature of working in IT.

        <h4>What's up Next?</h4>
        <p>
            Next up on the docket for this site is some more posts about topics of interest, projects I've dove into, and potentially more relating to other areas of interest outside of software. Stay tuned!
